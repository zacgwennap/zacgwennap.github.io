## Who I Am
I graduated from the **University of California, Berkeley** in December 2024 with a degree in **Mechanical Engineering** and a GPA of 3.65. My journey has been shaped by diverse experiences, including a memorable stint as an [intern at NASA Headquarters](https://www.nasa.gov/stem-content/x-59-3d-printing/) and over two years as an undergraduate researcher at the [Additive Manufacturing and Metamaterials Lab (AMML)](https://www.raynexzheng.com/).

Beyond school and work, I’m an avid rock climber and an enthusiast for designing and building 3D printers. I find joy in creating systems that blend creativity, precision, and innovation.
